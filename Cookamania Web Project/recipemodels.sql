Cover with plastic wrap and chill to set.-\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd chocolate and cream into a large microwave safe bowl. Microwave for 20 seconds at a time, mixing each time until smooth. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside to set. Alternatively, you may melt it using a double boiler. Fill a medium sized pot with 1/3 of the way with water. Bring to a boil. Place bowl with chocolate and cream over the top and gently mix until mixture is completely melted and smooth. To soften the ganache to spreading or piping consistency microwave for 10 seconds at a time, mixing each time with a large spatula until it reaches the right consistency so that youâre able to pipe it and it still holds itâs shape. A single round of 10 seconds usually does it.-\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd half the icing sugar and almond flour into a food processor and process until well combined. Repeat with the other half. This will help get rid of any lumps in the sugar. Alternatively, you may sift the two together. This must be done at least 3 times.-\r\n\r\nEmpty the almond mixture into a large mixing bowl, add the first portion of egg whites and mix until it forms a paste. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside.-\r\n\r\nAdd the sugar and water into a small saucepan. Give them a very gentle stir to get them mixed together. Bring to a boil on medium high heat, then turn down to a simmer. Add a candy thermometer to the pot to help you measure the temp of the syrup. As the syrup bubbles away it will splatter small bubbles of sugared water on the sides of the pot. Use a pastry brush dabbed in a little water to brush those back into the syrup. This will help prevent the syrup from crystallising. When the syrup reaches 115C, add the second portion of egg whites to the bowl of a stand mixer and start whisking them on medium/high speed to help break them apart and get them a little frothy.-\r\n\r\nWhen the syrup reaches 118C, pour it over the egg whites in a slow and steady stream. Whisk to stiff peaks for about 6 min. Add the pink food gel and rose water at about the 3 min point, whisk into the meringue for a couple of minutes. Stop the mixer and scrape down, then whisk for an extra couple of minutes. When you can turn the bowl over and the meringue doesnât fall out, you know youâve reached stiff peaks.-\r\n\r\nGrab a spatula full of the meringue and fold it into the almond-sugar mixture, mix until well combined. This allows the mixture to thin out a little before you add the rest of the mixture. Fold everything together by going around the bowl with a spatula then through the middle (as demonstrated in the video). Continue folding until the batter gets thin enough that it drips off the spatula and falls in a ribbon. It should take about 10 seconds for the ribbon to disappear into the rest of the batter. Thatâs when you know the batter is ready to pipe.-\r\n\r\nSpoon the batter into a piping bag with a round tip.-\r\n\r\nPipe rounds of batter about 3.5cm (1.38 inches) in diameter, spacing them 2cm apart on (flat) baking trays lined with baking parchment. Sprinkle with crushed pistachios.-\r\n\r\nGently tap the tray on the work surface covered with a kitchen cloth. Leave to stand for at least 30 minutes, until a skin forms on the shells. They shouldnât be sticky when you touch them. Itâs at this point that you can preheat a fan forced oven to 180C (360F)-\r\n\r\nBake for 12 minutes. If you feel your oven is causing the macarons to brown on one side (usually the side closest to the fan) turn the tray around about half way through baking.

Allow the tins to cool for 2 min and then carefully flip the cake tins over on to a cooling wrack to cool completely before using. Chill for 4 hours or overnight before using.-\r\n\r\nUsing a large serrated knife, carefully trim the top off each layer of cake to make even and flat layers. Try to aim to get them all the same height. An easy way to do this is to find the lowest height of the cake, place a skewer or toothpick next to that point and mark it. As you go around each side of the cake cutting it, use the marked skewer to make sure each cut is at the same height. Youâll end up with two layers from each cake tin. So 4 layers of cake in total.-\r\n\r\nTo prepare crumb coat, add a dab of frosting onto an 8â cake board or serving plate. Add first cake layer. Use a small offset to add a layer of frosting and smoothen out and layer the frosting on each layer before adding the next layer of cake. Add more frosting around the outside to fill the grooves between each layer. This should just be a neat thin layer of frosting which is aimed at trapping any cake crumbs so that random bits of cake crumbs donât show up on the outside of the cake. Chill for 2 hours or overnight.-\r\n\r\nFrosting-\r\n\r\nSet 2 tbsp of frosting aside in a small bowl.-\r\n\r\nSo the way weâre going to colour the frosting is by starting with the lightest shade, take some of that out then add more colour to darken the frosting. So begin by adding the blue food gel and bubblegum essence to the remaining buttercream, mix using a hand mixer or in a stand mixer (a hand whisk will not work, you need high speed whisking to get the colour to mix in properly).-\r\n\r\nSet Â¼ of the frosting aside before you add the next lot of colour for the medium shade of blue, followed by the dark shade and midnight blue. So youâll end up with 4 bowls of frosting each with a different shade.-\r\n\r\nAdd each shade to a piping bag and snip off the end.-\r\n\r\nBegin by frosting the lightest shade of blue frosting around the bottom of the. Then use the next shade, followed by the dark blue and finish with the midnight blue.-\r\n\r\nUse a small offset spatula to evenly spread the frosting around the top. Then use a bench scraper to go around the cake to smoothen out the sides. You may need to go around the cake a couple times so make sure you scrape off the excess frosting each time avoid mucking up the blue ombre.-\r\n\r\nTo finish add some of the white frosting to set aside in the beginning into a piping bag fitted with a small round tip. Pipe some random dots of frosting toward the top of the cake and then pipe random lines connecting some of the dots. Finish off by piping some star dots on the top of the cake.', '6'),

Spray an 8â cake tin with oil spray and line the bottom with baking paper.-\r\n\r\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add the flour, baking powder, caster sugar and salt. Turn mixer on low speed and allow it to mix for a couple minutes to help everything combine well (alternatively you may do this by sifting the ingredients together). Add the softened butter and mix until it resembles a fine sand like texture.-\r\n\r\nAdd the milk, oil, greek yogurt, eggs and strawberry essence into the bowl with the dry ingredients and mix on medium speed until no dry ingredients are visible. Scrape down the bowl and mix for another 20 seconds.-\r\n\r\nSeparate batter into three separate bowls. Add pink food dye and mix until well combined to one bowl. Repeat with two other bowls. Add pink and purple to make the purple and blue to make the blue. Be careful not to over mix your batter. You just want to fold the colour until well combined.-\r\n\r\nTransfer each colour into a separate piping bag and pipe random blobs of each colour into an 8 inch cake tin.

Allow the tins to cool for 2 min and then carefully flip the cake tins over on to a cooling rack to cool completely before using.-\r\n\r\nUsing a large serrated knife or cake leveler, carefully trim the top off each layer of cake to make even and flat layers. You can make each cake layer however thin or thick you like. I got about 3 useable layers of cake from each of the three cakes. Try to aim to get them all the same height. If you donât have a cake leveller, an easy way to do this is to find the lowest height of the cake, place a skewer or toothpick next to that point and mark it. As you go around each side of the cake cutting it, use the marked skewer to make sure each cut is at the same height.-\r\n\r\nTo prepare crumb coat, add a dab of frosting onto an 8â cake board or serving plate. Add first cake layer. Use a small offset to add a layer of frosting and smoothen out and layer the frosting on each layer before adding the next layer of cake. Add more frosting around the outside to fill the grooves between each layer. This should just be a neat thin layer of frosting which is aimed at trapping any cake crumbs so that random bits of cake crumbs donât show up on the outside of the cake.-\r\n\r\nAdd a fresh layer of frosting using a small offset spatula. Use a cake scraper to smoothen out the frosting around the sides. Then smoothen out the top using a the cake scraper. Chill.-\r\n\r\nSeparate two batches of Swiss meringue buttercream into three bowls. Colour each one blue, pink and purple using the same formulas as the batter.-\r\n\r\nTransfer to a piping bag and pipe two layers of frosting starting with the blue at the bottom, followed by the purple. I actually made a lighter purple as well, and then finish with the pink. Use a large cake scraper to go around the cake to smoothen out the frosting. Scrape any excess frosting on top using a sharp knife and use the cake leveller to even out the top. Continue scraping until the cake is smooth on the sides and top. Chill for 1-2 hours.-\r\n\r\nStick some sprinkles to the bottom of the cake using your hands.-\r\n\r\nDrizzle some chocolate sauce over the sides of the cake and chill again for 1 hour. Mix the gold lustre dust and vodka or vanilla extract together and use a small food safe brush to paint the chocolate drips with the gold. You may need to go over it twice. This takes a while guys. Have patience! Listen to BeyoncÃ© in the background or your favourite podcast!-\r\n\r\nFit the end of a piping bag with a Wilton 1M tip and frost some high swirls of pink Swiss meringue buttercream frosting. Make em high baby!-\r\n\r\nAdd the macarons on top to finish off, this is completely optional! If you want to use the macarons, Iâd recommend making them the day you bake the cake. This whole thing is a two day process. Baking and crumb coat and then the decorating. Store the macarons in an air tight container at room temp until youâre ready to use them! :0)', '10'),
