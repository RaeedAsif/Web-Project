      <h3>Random</h3>
      <div>+ There was a lawsuit that took place trying to prove that Pringles are not really potato chips.</div>
      <br/>
      <div>+ If you can get your hands on a really ripe cranberry, try bouncing it like a bouncy ball. Word on the street is they're supposed to bounce sky high.</div>
    </div>
    <div id="history" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>Historical</h3>
      <div>+ Before fridges were invented, or even iceboxes, Finns and Russians used to put frogs in their milk to help preserve it. Apparently some frogs do have peptides on their skin that help kill bacteria! We'll keep our fridge, though.</div>
      <br/>
      <div>+ Back in the fifth century, there were no fridges, so you had to eat your meat right away or figure something out. Attila the Hun's soldiers would press their meat under their saddles, drying it out and effectively curing it with the salt from their horse's sweat. Gross!!</div>
    </div>
    <div id="vegeterian" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>Vegiterian</h3>
      <div>+ The first Vegetarian Society was formed in 1847 in England. The main aim of the members was to dispel the common belief that it's not possible to lead a healthy life without eating meat.</div>
      <br/>
      <div>+ Vegetarianism has traditionally been linked to the people of ancient India. Even today, Indians make up more than 70 percent of the world's vegetarian population.</div>
    </div>
    <div id="fitness" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>Fitness</h3>
      <div>+ It’s surprising how many athletes do not eat enough to fuel their workouts and recovery. Inadequate calorie intake will result in reduced performance as well as an increased risk for injury, as your body does not have the nutrients it needs for recovery and repair of damaged muscle tissue. How do you know if you’re eating enough? Monitor your performance, body weight and body composition. A decrease in performance or loss in lean body mass is a result of insufficient calories.</div>
      <br/>
      <div>+ Increasing muscle mass will help increase resting metabolic rate and train your body to use more body fat as a fuel source rather than stored carbs. This will assist you in your quest to decrease body fat percentage. Consuming low-glycemic carbohydrate foods (e.g., whole grains, vegetables and beans) keeps your blood sugar and insulin levels in check. When blood sugar and insulin levels are constantly high from fast-acting carbs (e.g., white rice, fruit juice and cookies), the excess amount of glucose gets packaged into fat cells for storage. Each meal and snack should contain a balance of slow-digesting carbs, protein and healthy fat to keep insulin in check and prevent increasing body fat percentage. Choosing a variety of fresh, whole, clean foods and having a balance of macronutrients at every meal will help improve performance, enhance recovery, and repair damaged tissues so that it is easier to attain fitness goals.</div>
